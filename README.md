# Mind the Fog

Caulfield Road Studios presents:

MIND THE FOG

With magic and combat and all sorts of wild things like that.

All inquiries about fog related issues redirect to @akarle

Monster smashing, combat bashin, magic flashin type stuff to @mbkarle (also our \#1 beta tester).

Oh and @ckarle w the graphics yo if he ever does them ;)

## Install

Hopefully eventually we'll have a website running up at [mindthefog.com](http://www.mindthefog.com), but for right now, you've got to hack it yourself!

### Simple Play

The easiest way to play is just to open [game/index.html](game/index.html) in a browser. Believe it or not, this should work!

### Server Play

If you want to test out our simple server, or you want to host the game for all computers on your network, we've added our server to this repo as well!

```sh
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
